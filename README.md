This repository is a dump of my code and other files from a handful of courses at the University of Tennessee which were previously stored on the EECS department's computing cluster.

Note: The majority of my coursework is not represented here. Most of my code for upper-division courses, especially machine learning courses, was stored on my personal laptop. Although these programs better represent my current programming skills, I deleted them at the end of each semester to save disk space, so they are unfortunately gone forever.
