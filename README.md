This repository contains code and other files I authored at the University of Tennessee, which were previously stored on the EECS department's computing cluster.

Note: Not all coursework is represented here. Most of my code for upper-division courses, especially machine learning courses, was stored on my personal laptop. Although these programs better represent my current programming skills, I deleted them at the end of each semester to save disk space, so they are unfortunately gone forever.
