<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given a vector of numbers that represent heights of towers.
<LI> The vector will contain between 1 and 7 elements, and the elements will be
     between 1 and 47.
<LI> You want to place each tower on an integer coordinate on the x axis.
<LI> You want to make sure that every pair of adjacent towers is at least <i>u</i> units
     apart, where <i>u</i> is the height of the taller tower of the pair.
<LI> You want to minimize the distance between the first tower and the last.
<LI> To do this, you need to determine the optimal ordering of the towers.
<LI> Return the indices of the towers in this order.
<LI> If multiple orderings give you this minimized distance, then return the 
     ordering that is lexicographically the smallest.
</UL>

To help you, let's look at example 0:  <tt>{ 4, 7, 5 }</tt>.  There are six orderings of these
three towers.  Here is where you would place them on the x axis if the leftmost tower goes at
coordinate 0.  Note that these orderings are sorted lexicographically:

<pre>
{ 0, 1, 2 }: Tower with height 4 -> 0.   Tower with height 7: 7.   Tower with height 5: 14.
{ 0, 2, 1 }: Tower with height 4 -> 0.   Tower with height 7: 12.  Tower with height 5: 5.
{ 1, 0, 2 }: Tower with height 4 -> 7.   Tower with height 7: 0.   Tower with height 5: 12.
{ 1, 2, 0 }: Tower with height 4 -> 12.  Tower with height 7: 0.   Tower with height 5: 7.
{ 2, 0, 1 }: Tower with height 4 -> 5.   Tower with height 7: 12.  Tower with height 5: 0.
{ 2, 1, 0 }: Tower with height 4 -> 14.  Tower with height 7: 7.   Tower with height 5: 0.
</pre>

Four of these orderings have a distance of 12, and two have distance of 14.  So, you want
to return the lexicographically smallest ordering whose distance is 12.  That ordering
is: <tt> { 0, 2, 1 } </tt>

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>, 
I have a shell script 
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you 
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to 
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.

<h3>Hints</h3>

As with a lot of Topcoder problems, you'll be tempted to try to be smart with this one, and
do some variant of sorting the towers.  Don't succumb to that temptation.  The constraints
are so small that you can easily enumerate all orderings of towers,   
<p>
What kind of enumeration?  This is an enumeration of permutations of the indices of the
towers.  Go ahead and use <tt>next_permutation()</tt> from the C++ algorithms library to implement
this -- for each permutation, calculate the distance between the towers, and store the 
permutation that gives you the minimum.  Store the first of these, because <tt>next_permutation</tt>
runs in lexicographic order.  
<p>
What is the running time of this?  For a vector of size <i>n</i>, 
there are <i>(n!)</i> permutations,
so the running time is <i>O(n!)</i>.  Yes, that's slow, but since the maximum vector size is 7, and
(7!) = 5040, this will run easily within Topcoder's constraints.
