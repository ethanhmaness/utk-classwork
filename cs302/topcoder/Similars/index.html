This is a meaty topcoder problem, so I am going to walk you through a solution.
Treat this like a lab in physics or chemistry -- you have a bunch of tasks to do in 
order, and in doing them, you'll either learn new things, or reinforce the learning
that you already have!

<hr>
<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> We define the <i>similarity</i> of two numbers, written in decimal with no leading
     zeros, to be the number of distinct digits that they have in common.
<LI> For example, the similarity of 1123 and 331 is two -- they both have the digits 1
     and 3 in common.
<LI> You are given two numbers: <b>L</b>, which is any number from 1 and 99,999, and <b>R</b>,
     which is any number between <b>(L+1)</b> and 100,000.
<LI> Your job is to return the maximum similarity of any pair of numbers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>,
     such that <b>L &le; a < b &le; R</b>.
</UL>
<hr>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
#   L      R      Answer
-   ---    ----   ------
0   1      10     1: This is when a=1 and b=10.
1   1      99     2: There are many pairs with similarity 2, for example (23,32) and (38,83).
2   99     100    0: There is only one pair (99, 100).  It's similarity is zero.
3   1000   1010   2
4   444    454    2
</pre>

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>,
I have a shell script
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you 
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.

<hr>
<h3>Main.cpp is a little different</h3>

First, my 
<a href=main.cpp><b>main.cpp</b></a> program works differently than normal.  When 
you compile it, you should make sure that your <b>Similars</b> class has two public
strings in it named
<b>Print_Sets</b> and <b>Print_Similarities</b>.  My skeleton
(<b><a href=Similars.cpp>Similars.cpp</a></b>) has these, and compiles fine with <b>main.cpp</b>.
<p>
Below, I show you the skeleton, how it compiles and how it runs.  First, here's
<b><a href=Similars.cpp>Similars.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;

class Similars {
  public:
    string Print_Sets;
    string Print_Similarities;
    int maxsim(int L, int R);
};

int Similars::maxsim(int L, int R)
{
  printf("L = %d.  R = %d.\n", L, R);
  if (Print_Sets == "y") printf("Print_Sets was set.\n");
  if (Print_Similarities == "y") printf("Print_Similarities was set.\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And here's how to compile and run:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ main.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out</b></font>
usage: ./a.out L R print-sets(y|n) print-similarities(y|n)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1 10 n n</b></font>
L = 1.  R = 10.
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 20 30 y n </b></font>
L = 20.  R = 30.
Print_Sets was set.
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 44 55 n y</b></font>
L = 44.  R = 55.
Print_Similarities was set.
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


Instead of giving my program the example number, like you usually do, 
you give it <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>,
and two <b>y|n</b> arguments, which specify whether to print the sets and similarities.  
I'll tell you what "sets" and "similarities" are below.
If you say "y" to the first of these, it sets the variable
<b>Print_Sets</b> to "y", and my program prints the sets.
If you say "y" to the second of these, it sets the variable
<b>Print_Similarities</b> to "y", and my program prints the similarities.
You don't have to use <b>Print_Sets</b> or <b>Print_Similarities</b>, but you'll
need to define them to make them work with <b>main.cpp</b>.  The 
nice thing about using them is that you can debug with them, and your programs will
still work when you submit them to Topcoder (since Topcoder won't set them to "y" -- 
they will just be empty strings.

<hr>
<h3>The straightforward approach doesn't work</h3>

The straightforward way to solve this program would be to test the similarity of
every pair of numbers from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b> in a set of nested <b>for</b> loops.
Unfortunately, that won't work, because when <b>L</b> is one and <b>R</b> is 100,000, 
that <b>for</b> loop will run for (100,000 * 100,000) iterations.  That's too big
(you get roughly 1,000,000 iterations with topcoder.  Maybe 10,000,000 on a good day.).

<hr>
<h3>Representing the digits present in a number</h3>

Instead, let's think about what we want to look at with each number -- we want to 
look at the digits that are represented in the number.  For example, the number
123 has the digits 1, 2 and 3, and the number 11,155 has the digits 1 and 5.  
You can view the digits as a set: The number 123 has the digit set {1,2,3}, and
11,155 has {1,5}.  The similarity of two numbers is the size of the intersection of
its digit sets.  For example, the similarity is 123 and 11,155 is one:
<p>
<center>
{1,2,3} &cap; {1,5} = {1}
</center>
<p>
The similarity of 15,225 and 52,110 is three:
<p>
<center>
{1,2,5} &cap; {0,1,2,5} = {1,2,5}
</center>
<p>

Now, how many potential digit sets are there?  That's the same as asking, "How big
is the power set of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}?"  That's 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024.  That's
a very nice and manageably small number.
<p>
The best way to represent a small set like this is in binary.  If digit <i>i</i> is
set in a number, than its set will have the bit <i>(1 &lt;&lt; i)</i> set to one.
For example:

<p><center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
    <td align=center>Set</td>
    <td align=center>Binary</td>
    <td align=center>Hex</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>{1}</td>
<td align=center>0000000010</td>
<td align=center>0x2</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>{1,2,3}</td>
<td align=center>0000001110</td>
<td align=center>0xe</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>{1,5}</td>
<td align=center>0000100010</td>
<td align=center>0x22</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>{1,2,5}</td>
<td align=center>0000100110</td>
<td align=center>0x26</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>{0,1,2,5}</td>
<td align=center>0000100111</td>
<td align=center>0x27</td></tr></table><p></center>

<h3>Your first job in solving this problem: Compute the digit set for a number</h3>

So, write up the code to do this for each number from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b>, 
and if <b>Print_Sets</b> equals "y", print it out:  That's what my code does, so 
here are some examples (don't worry about "Occurrences" or the last line yet -- just
make sure that the sets equal mine).

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1 2 y n </b></font>
i =      1.  Set = 0x002.  Occurrences =   1
i =      2.  Set = 0x004.  Occurrences =   1
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 123 129 y n</b></font>
i =    123.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   1
i =    124.  Set = 0x016.  Occurrences =   1
i =    125.  Set = 0x026.  Occurrences =   1
i =    126.  Set = 0x046.  Occurrences =   1
i =    127.  Set = 0x086.  Occurrences =   1
i =    128.  Set = 0x106.  Occurrences =   1
i =    129.  Set = 0x206.  Occurrences =   1
2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 11115 11116 y n</b></font>
i =  11115.  Set = 0x022.  Occurrences =   1
i =  11116.  Set = 0x042.  Occurrences =   1
1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 11155 11156 y n</b></font>
i =  11155.  Set = 0x022.  Occurrences =   1
i =  11156.  Set = 0x062.  Occurrences =   1
2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 52110 52111 y n</b></font>
i =  52110.  Set = 0x027.  Occurrences =   1
i =  52111.  Set = 0x026.  Occurrences =   1

<h3>Job 2: A Map</h3>

Your second job should be to create a map, keyed on the set number, whose val is the
number of times you've seen that set.  This will be important to keep track of.
You can test it as I do, by printing out each set, and the number of times that the set
has occurred, as you calculate the set number.  In the example below, you can see that
1 and 11 both create the same set number, which raises the "Occurrences" of 0x2 to 2:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1 11 y n </b></font>
i =      1.  Set = 0x002.  Occurrences =   1
i =      2.  Set = 0x004.  Occurrences =   1
i =      3.  Set = 0x008.  Occurrences =   1
i =      4.  Set = 0x010.  Occurrences =   1
i =      5.  Set = 0x020.  Occurrences =   1
i =      6.  Set = 0x040.  Occurrences =   1
i =      7.  Set = 0x080.  Occurrences =   1
i =      8.  Set = 0x100.  Occurrences =   1
i =      9.  Set = 0x200.  Occurrences =   1
i =     10.  Set = 0x003.  Occurrences =   1
i =     11.  Set = 0x002.  Occurrences =   2
1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1231 1233 y n</b></font>
i =   1231.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   1
i =   1232.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   2
i =   1233.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   3

<h3>Job 3: Iterating through the map</h3>

Now that you have your map, you want to iterate through all pairs of elements.
For each pair, you'll calculate the set intersection, and then use bit arithmetic 
to calculate the size of the intersection.  If the number of occurrences of a set is
two or more, you'll want to compare the intersection of the set with itself, because two
numbers have the same set.   In that case, you don't need to compare it to any other
elements (Why?  Because it can't have a higher similarity with any other set than it has
to itself).
<p>
This is a nested <b>for</b> loop with iterators.  I had the first iterator go from
<b>begin()</b> to <b>end()</b>.  Then, if the element to which the iterator pointed
had only one occurrence, I had a second iterator that started one past the first iterator
stopped when it got to <b>end()</b>.  I recorded the maximum similarity of
all of iterators with the first.  
If the first iterator's element had two or more occurrences, then I simply calculated
its similarity with itself.

<p>
Go ahead and write these loops and print out the set ids, and their intersections
(which is simply the bitwise AND operator (&amp;)).  Compare them with my program, and
for now, ignore the "similarities".   Just make sure your loop is printing out the
right S1's and S2's, and the right intersections, first when all of the occurrences are one.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1 4 y y </b></font>
i =      1.  Set = 0x002.  Occurrences =   1
i =      2.  Set = 0x004.  Occurrences =   1
i =      3.  Set = 0x008.  Occurrences =   1
i =      4.  Set = 0x010.  Occurrences =   1
S1: 0x002  S2: 0x004  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
S1: 0x002  S2: 0x008  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
S1: 0x002  S2: 0x010  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
S1: 0x004  S2: 0x008  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
S1: 0x004  S2: 0x010  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
S1: 0x008  S2: 0x010  S1&S2: 0x000  Similarity: 0
0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 9871 9874 y y</b></font>
i =   9871.  Set = 0x382.  Occurrences =   1
i =   9872.  Set = 0x384.  Occurrences =   1
i =   9873.  Set = 0x388.  Occurrences =   1
i =   9874.  Set = 0x390.  Occurrences =   1
S1: 0x382  S2: 0x384  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
S1: 0x382  S2: 0x388  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
S1: 0x382  S2: 0x390  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
S1: 0x384  S2: 0x388  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
S1: 0x384  S2: 0x390  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
S1: 0x388  S2: 0x390  S1&S2: 0x380  Similarity: 3
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

And next when you have multiple occurrences of the same set:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out 1231 1233 y y</b></font>
i =   1231.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   1
i =   1232.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   2
i =   1233.  Set = 0x00e.  Occurrences =   3
S1: 0x00e  S2: 0x00e  S1&S2: 0x00e  Similarity: 3
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Job 4: Calculating the similarites</h3>

This is your last job -- for each intersection, calculate its size, again with bit
arithmetic.  Test your code with mine, calculate the maximum, and you are ready to 
submit.

<hr>
<h3>Why is this fast enough?</h3>

The maximum size of your map is 1024, or 2<sup>10</sup>, so your nested <b>for</b> loop, which is 
an <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> loop, is 2<sup>20</sup>.  That's fast enough for topcoder!
