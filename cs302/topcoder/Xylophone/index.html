<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> There are keys on a xylophone, numbered 1 to 50.
<LI> Each key corresponds to a note which is identified by a letter from <tt>A</tt>
     to <tt>G</tt>.
<LI> Key 1 corresponds to <tt>A</tt>; key 2 corresponds to <tt>B</tt>, and so on up to 
     key 7, which corresponds to <tt>G</tt>.  
<LI> Then, they start over, so key 8 corresponds to <tt>A</tt>;
     key 9 corresponds to <tt>B</tt>, and so on up to 
     key 14, which corresponds to <tt>G</tt>.  
<LI> They keep cycling like that.
<LI> You are given a vector <b>keys</b>, which contains up to 50 elements, which are each
     numbers between 1 and 50.
<LI> You should return the number of distinct notes in <b>key</b>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
Number   Input                              Answer
-----    ---------------------------------- ------
0)       {1,8,3}                            2: The notes are A, A and C.  That's two distinct notes.
1)       {7,3,2,4,1,5,6}                    7: A through G are all in keys
2)       {1,8,15}                           1: These are all A
3)       {25,1,17,9,8}                      4
4)       {11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11} 1
5)       {50,10,20,30,11,30,24,38,5,2,9}    6
</pre>

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>,
I have a shell script
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.

Each key on the Xylophone maps to one of seven notes.  You don't care what the notes
are.  You just want to know which distinct notes are played.  So, take each key played, 
and calculate its value mod 7.  That value will be different for each note (For example,
if you play an A, and then a B, the first key mod 7 will not equal the second key mod 7.
However, if you play two A's, even on different keys, then their values mod 7 will be
the same).
<p>
So what you want to do is count the number of distinct values there are when you take
each key mod 7.  There are two straightforward ways to do this:
<OL>
<LI> Have a vector whose size is seven.  Set a vector's entry to one, whenever the key
mod 7 equals the entry's index.  Then sum the vector's entries.
<LI> Have a set of integers, and insert each (key mod 7) into the set.  Since you cannot
insert duplicates into sets, at the end, the size of the set will be your answer.
</OL>

Which of these is faster?  The first one -- it is <i>O(n)</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number
of keys.  The second one is <i>O(n log(n)).</i>
