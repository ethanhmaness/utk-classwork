<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given a vector of integers, named <i>N</i>.
<LI> <i>v's</i> size is &le; 1000 and the elements of <i>N</i> are between 1 and 1,000.
     (I've increased the topcoder constraints -- they were originally 100 and 100).
<LI> The elements of <i>N</i> are distinct.
<LI> Let <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> be any two distinct elements of <i>N</i>, and suppose that <i>i &gt; m</i>.  Calculate <i>i/j</i>, using integer division.  If it is not in <i>N</i> add it to <i>N</i>.
<LI> Continue doing this until you can't add any more elements of <i>N</i>
<LI> Return the size of <i>N</i>.
<LI> BTW, it doesn't matter what order you add elements to <i>N</i>.  The answer will always
     be the same.

<h3>The examples</h3>

<pre>
 #  |    N                        |  Answer
--- | --------------------------- | -------
 0  | { 9, 2 }                    | 3: You'll add 9/2 = 4, but then you're done.
 1  | { 8, 2 }                    | 3: Ditto.
 2  | { 50 }                      | 1: There are no pairs of elements.
 3  | { 1, 5, 8, 30, 15, 4 }      | 11: You'll add 2, 3, 6, 7 and 10.
 4  | { 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 }  | 7: You're already done.
 5  | { 6, 2, 18 }                | 7: You'll add 1, 3, 4 and 9.

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>, 
I have a shell script 
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you 
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to 
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.

<h3>Hints</h3>

This one tripped up many of the Topcoder contestants -- See if you can do better!
<p>
The constraints of this problem state that <b>N</b> only holds numbers between 1 and 1,000,
and <b>N.size()</b> is &le; 1,000.
Since (<i>a</i> div <i>b</i>) is always going to be less than <i>a</i>, the numbers in <i>N</i>
will always be between 1 and 1,000.
That puts some constraints on input that we can leverage.  
In particular, if our solution is <i>O(<b>N.size()</b><sup>2</sup>)</i>, it will be
fast enough.
<p>
Here's a solution that comes to mind -- keep two collections of numbers: those that you
have processed (call it <b>P</b> -- it will be a vector), 
and the vector <i>N</i>.
You can also maintain a vector, which we'll call <b>T</b>, that tells us in <i>O(1)</i> time
whether a number is in <i>v</i>.  It will contain 1,001 booleans, and <b>T[i]</b> is <b>true</b>
if <i>i</i> is in <i>N</i>.  It is <b>false</b> otherwise.
<p>
Now do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Set <b>T[<i>n</i>]</b> to <b>true</b> for each element <i>n</i> in <b>N</b>
<LI> Set <b>P</b> to be empty.
<LI> Now, for each element <i>n</i> in <b>N</b>, do the following:
<UL>
<p>
<LI> For each element <i>p</i> in <b>P</b>, find <i>k = (n div p)</i>, or 
<i>k = (p div n)</i>, whichever is non-zero.
<LI> Check <b>T</b> to see if <i>T[k]</i> is <b>true</b>.  If it is, ignore <i>k</i>.
<LI> Otherwise, set <b>T[j]</b> to <b>true</b>, and add <i>k</i> to <b>N</b>.
<LI> When you're done with each element in <b>P</b>, add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>.
</UL>
<p>

<LI> Finally, return the size of <b>N</b> or <b>P</b>.  They will both be the same size.

</UL>

Let's illustrate this with Example 0, where <b>numbers</b> is { 9, 2 }.  Below is the
initial state of the three vectors (we only show the first 12 elements of <b>T</b>, 
because all of the higher ones will always be false.  Also, in the pictures, 1 is
<b>true</b> and 0 is <b>false</b>):

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=DBZ0.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Now, run through <b>N</b> with an integer <i>i</i>.  When <i>i = 0</i>, <i>n = 9</i>.
We want to run through <b>P</b>, but <b>P</b> is empty, so we're done with <i>n</i> -- we
add it to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=DBZ1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Next, <i>i = 1</i> and <i>n = 2</i>.  We run through <b>P</b> and there is one element: <i>p = 9</i>.  Since <i>p</i> is bigger than <i>n</i>, we set <i>k = (p div n) = 4</i>.  We check to see
if <b>T[4]</b> = 0, which it does, so we set <b>T[4] = 1</b> and add 4 to <b>N</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=DBZ2.jpg></td></table></center><p>

At this point, we're done with <b>P</b>, so we add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=DBZ3.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Finally, we continue with <i>i = 2</i> and <i>n = 4</i>.  We run through <b>P</b>: When
<i>p = 9</i>, <i>k = 2</i>, and since <b>T[2]</b> equals 1, we ignore <i>k</i>.  Similarly, when
<i>p = 2</i>, <i>k</i> also equals 2, and since <b>T[2]</b> equals 1, we ignore <i>k</i> again.  
At this point, we're done with <b>P</b>, so we add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=DBZ4.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Now, we're done with <b>N</b>, so we return the size of <b>P</b>, which is three.  As you can
see, when we're done, <b>P</b> and <b>N</b> will be identical, so we could simply return 
the size of <b>N</b>.
<hr>
Let's think about the running time of this algorithm.  
Suppose there end up being <i>n</i> elements
of <b>N</b>.  Then our checking loop runs <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> times.  Inside the loop we
do an "if", a division, a check of <b>T[j]</b>, potentially a <b>push_back()</b> to <b>N</b>
and setting <b>T[j]</b> to <b>true</b>, and a <b>push_back()</b> to <b>P</b>.  All of those
are <i>O(1)</i>.  So our program is <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>.  With <i>n</i> capped at 1,000,
this is fast enough for topcoder.
<p>
Now think about the choice of data structure for <i>T</i>.  Because the values of <i>v</i>
are limited to &le; 1000, we can make <i>T</i> a vector of size 1,001, and checking to see 
whether a value is in <i>N</i> is <i>O(1)</i>.
<p>
Suppose <i>T</i> were instead a set.  Then checking would be <i>O(log n)</i>, and 
our program would run in <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>log n)</i>.
<p>
And finally, suppose that we didn't use <i>T</i> at all, but instead used <i>N</i>.
Then checking would be <i>O(n)</i>, and our program would be <i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i>.
As always, our choice of data structure is very important!
